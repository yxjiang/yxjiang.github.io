   \begin{itemize}
   \vspace{-5pt}
    \item \emph{Intelligent Cloud Capacity Management.}
    This project focused on cloud capacity prediction, one of the emerging problems by which the cloud service providers are concerned. We proposed an integrated solution of intelligent cloud capacity estimation for the IBM Smart Cloud Enterprise (SCE) to reduce the unnecessary energy consumption. %In particular, a novel asymmetric and heterogeneous error measure is first proposed to model over-estimation and under-estimation and to guide the prediction process. Then, the future provisioning demand is predicted based on the provisioning history via an ensemble method and the future de-provisioning is inferred based on the life span distributions of VMs along with the life time of active VMs. Finally, the cloud capacity is estimated using the active VMs and the future provisioning/de-provisioning demands.
    \item \emph{Cloud Service Provisioning Demands Prediction}.
    The promise of cloud computing is to provide computing resources instantly whenever they are needed. The state-of-the-art virtual machine (VM) provisioning technology can provision a VM in tens of minutes. This latency may be satisfiable for non-urgent jobs but it is unacceptable for jobs that need to scale out during computation. We designed an online temporal data mining system for modeling and predicting the cloud VM demand, then provision VMs in advance. %Experimental results using historical data from an IBM cloud in operation demonstrate that we can reduce 80\% of the provisioning time on average and hence significantly improve the cloud service quality and provide the possibility for on-the-fly provisioning.

   \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{System Event Summarization}.
    This project focuses on facilitating the diagnosis of computer systems based on system logs summarization. We proposed a novel framework called \emph{Natural Event Summarization (NES)} to summarizes the event log by capturing the temporal pattern among events. Given the system log, NES is able to discovery the multi-party relationships among events and facilitate the analytic tasks of the system administrators. %Our framework uses the minimum description length principle to guide the process in order to balance between accuracy and brevity. Also, we use multi-resolution analysis for pruning the problem space. We demonstrate how the principles can be applied to generate summaries with periodic patterns and correlation patterns in the framework. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show our method is capable of producing usable event summary, robust to noises, and scalable.

    \item \emph{Dynamic Query Form for Database Query}.
    This project focuses on facilitating complicated query tasks for users. We proposed a query system that is convenient for non-expert user to query information from semi-structured data. The system is able to dynamically generate query form that satisfy the potential requirement of the users by inferencing the intention of the users during interaction. %The system has good performance on the aspects of system storage efficiency, query efficiency and interface friendliness. The goal of the system is to help the users to get the information they need as fast and convenient as possible.
