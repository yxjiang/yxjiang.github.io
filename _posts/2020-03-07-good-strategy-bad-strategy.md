"Good strategy, bad strategy" is a book about how to create good strategies. Strategy is a term usually used by the MBAs. As a person live in the silicon valley, I know "MBA" is usually a derogatory word due to the track records of companies led by executives with MBA degree lost battles to the newbie startup founders. However, I'd say the loss of those MBA-led companies are probably due to slow execution instead of bad strategy. After reading this book, I'm really impressed by the thought process on designing good strategies proposed by the author. 

## Good strategy vs. bad strategy

The first part of this book is about diagnosis. To define a good strategy, one needs to first know what a good strategy and a bad strategy look like. Each good strategy is unique and designed case by case, and bad strategies have a lot in common and seems to be one-fit-all. Some very common characteristics of bad strategies as follows:

- **Fluff**. A strategy looks fancy with superficially restatement but do not convey the information of any concrete plan.
- **Failure to face the challenge**. A strategy that set arbitrary direction without identifying the major obstacles and prioritize accordingly.
- **Mistaking goals for strategy**. A strategy that only set the destination without developing a coherent approaches or guidelines on reaching the goal.
- **Bad strategic objectives**. A strategy that has some objectives but would lead the org to the wrong direction.

## How to design good strategy

As the book pointed out, defining a goal without guidelines on action is not a good strategy, so a good strategy of defining a good strategy should come with guidelines. In the second part of this book, the author listed a number of points that people can look into to help define good strategies: 

- **Use leverage**. A good strategy may have insight into a pivot point that will magnify the effects of focused energy and resources.
- **Create proximate objectives**. A good strategy may contain a good proximate objective that is able to reduce the ambiguity of the mission, passing on the organization a simpler problem that is more measurable and solvable.
- **Design chain-link system**. A good strategy can be building a well-managed chain-link system that is difficult to replicate.
- **Be focus**. Focusing has been emphasized in many books talk about productive/management. This book is not an exception.
- **Use advantage**. A good strategy can be doubling down on the advantages, including deepening or/and broadening the advantages, creating higher demand for advantaged products/services, as well as isolating mechanisms that block easy replication and imitation by competitors.
- **Use dynamics**. A good strategy can be riding the waves or find fresh undefended high ground via innovation. The trend can have multiplier effect to the outcome.
- **Using inertia**. A good strategy can owe a great deal to the inertia and inefficiency of the rivals.

One does not need to prescriptively check each of the points, but they are helpful guidelines on defining good strategies.
