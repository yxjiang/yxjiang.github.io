Hi, I'm Yexi. A father and a Machine Learning engineer.

I'm currently with Advanced Technologies Group of [Uber Technologies Inc.](http://www.uber.com) and is a Tech Lead Manager at the Machine Learning Platform team. Previously, I worked at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](http://www.watson.ibm.com/), and [Microsoft Research Asia](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/asia/), working on various machine learning related projects/products such as News Feed, Friend recommendation, data mining applications on improving cloud system management, and Office user behavior mining.

Besides, I also engage in the Open Source community as a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org), where I am a PMC member and committer of the BSP-based distributed computing framework - [Apache Hama](http://hama.apache.org), mainly working on the distributed machine learning module.
